# HeadPose-Random-Forest-
Headpose using random forest and gabor filters.

# Dataset
http://crowley-coutaz.fr/Head%20Pose%20Image%20Database.html
As per my knowledge this dataset is available for research as well as commercial work.

# Research Papers
1. https://bobetocalo.github.io/pdf/paper_amdo16.pdf [Code is provided in the same link in C++]

# Inspiration
I did this project in less than an hour, the goal is to get result close to the paper rather replicate the work in python.
There is no exisitng model to label heapose for commercial purpose.
